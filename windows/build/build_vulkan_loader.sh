# The Vulkan loader both routes put in the game folder: the Khronos loader with
# two patches, 64-bit.
#
# Why a loader at all: in the game folder the game runs on DXVK / vkd3d-proton,
# i.e. on Vulkan, and ReShade's Vulkan backend is a Vulkan layer. A layer is
# normally registered in HKLM for every Vulkan program on the machine; this
# loader instead reads layer manifests from vk-override\implicit_layer\ beside
# itself (windows/vulkan-loader/patch-local-override.py), so the install stays
# inside the game folder. DXVK and vkd3d-proton load vulkan-1.dll by name, so
# the copy in the game folder is the one they get. Drivers are found the normal
# way (the package ships no vk-override\nr-icd.json).
# patch-no-dxgi.py: the stock loader calls CreateDXGIFactory1 while creating an
# instance; with OptiScaler as dxgi.dll that reaches DXVK's dxgi, which creates
# an instance through this loader again (the likely cause of 7 Days to Die
# hanging at start in the first Windows package test).
#
